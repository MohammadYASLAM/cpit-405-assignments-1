                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p style="font-style: italic;" class="about-text">Welcome to my personal website! My name is Mohammad
                    Yaslam ASM, and I’m so glad you stopped by! From a young age, I’ve been deeply passionate about
                    computers, technology, and video games, which has had a significant influence on my personal growth
                    and career journey. I grew up fascinated by how things work behind the scenes, and this curiosity
                    led me to explore various aspects of technology. Now, I live in Jeddah, a vibrant city in Saudi
                    Arabia that is known for its beautiful coastline and rich cultural heritage. It's a great place to
                    live, and I’m fortunate to be part of its ever-evolving tech scene.

                    I graduated from the Faculty of Computing and Information Technology (FCIT), where I gained a solid
                    foundation in the field of Information Technology. During my time there, I not only learned about
                    the technical aspects of IT but also developed a strong problem-solving mindset and teamwork skills
                    that have proven invaluable in my professional career. I’m proud to say that my academic journey has
                    shaped me into a well-rounded IT professional, always seeking to stay ahead of the curve.

                    Professionally, I am passionate about both web development and system administration. With web
                    development, I enjoy the creativity and technical challenges of designing user-friendly websites
                    that function seamlessly across different platforms. I also specialize in system administration,
                    ensuring that the backbone of IT systems runs smoothly, with minimal downtime and maximum
                    efficiency. Over the years, I have gained extensive experience in troubleshooting, server
                    management, and automation. I’m always excited to take on new projects that push me to explore
                    cutting-edge technologies and grow my expertise.

                    In my free time, you’ll often find me exploring new technologies, building personal projects, or
                    diving into the world of gaming, where I get to relax and also learn about game development and
                    design. I strongly believe that technology is an ever-evolving field, and to keep up with it,
                    continuous learning and adaptation are key. My goal is to continue growing in this field,
                    contributing to innovative projects, and using technology to create solutions that make a
                    difference. I hope you find my website informative and engaging, and feel free to connect with me if
                    you share similar interests or want to collaborate on exciting tech projects!. <a href="#education"
